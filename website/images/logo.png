This is a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would need to:

1. Use a tool like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or an online SVG-to-PNG converter to convert the SVG files to PNG format.
2. Ensure the PNGs have appropriate sizes (e.g., logo.png should be at least 200x200px).
3. Place the converted PNGs in this directory.

SVG files have been created for all the necessary graphics in SVG format. These can be used directly in the HTML for better quality, or converted to PNG as needed.
